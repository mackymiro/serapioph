						Dear Serapio,<br>
						About 25 years ago, I put myself in your shoe as I present my research output in my industrial psychology class about the life of the seafarers onboard I titled it "Life Over Troubled Waters". It was a qualitative research where together with my research team we boarded a ship bound for Mindanao wherein back and forth we conducted interviews among the crew with the approval of their human resource department. 
						<br><br>
						Two years back then, I was so fascinated of taking a maritime course, unfortunately out of poverty I was intimidated with the white uniforms that appears to me very expensive which in my circumstance would not permit me to pursue my dream. 
						In 1998, I was coincidentally hired as a guidance counselor in a maritime school where the process of "marinating" myself started, a term used by all of us who are not seafarers but by chance has to understand the life of every seafarer being an employee of a maritime school and dealing with maritime partners and clientele. From my initial entry as guidance counselor, I started immersing myself to the journey of every Serapio. 
						<br><br>
						I build up my career in the maritime world taking an active participation in molding every Serapio as social sciences instructor primarily handling psychology classes. Then I was taking a more challenging career as quality manager ensuring the university's compliance to international standard. 
						Discerning that a more meaningful career awaits me in Serapio's world, I relinquish my quality management representative position. I engage myself to different maritime institution an entrepreneur and as a consultant. 
						<br>
						<br>
						Knowing and understanding the circumstances of every Serapio, with 25 years of marinating myself, I felt the calling to reach out every Serapio who needs a personalized virtual assistant and extend guidance and professional help towards work life balance.

						Kinsa si Serapio? 
						<br><br>
						Ang matag-usa nga nangandoy ug kalambuan ug makasugakod sa dagkong balod sa kadagatan adunay kahigayonan nga mamahimong us ka Serapio. Mahimong sa kasamtangan usa ka tinun-an nga nagkuha ug kurso nga pang marino o usa ka yanong mamomuo nga ang kansang kakugi ug kahanas makatampo sa luwas ug hapsay nga paglawig sa usa ka bapor nga pangpatigayon. 
						<br><br>
						Unsa ang angay nga buhaton alang sa pagtuman sa damgo nga mahimong us ka malampusong Serapio? Ang unang batonon mao ang hugot nga paghukom sa kaugalingong laraw alang sa pagsagubang sa mga hagit ug babag sa kalamboan. Gikinahanglan nga maka baton ug libro de biyahe (Seaman's Book) nga makuha sa buhatan sa MARINA, sa pinakaduol nga rehiyon. Kung ikaw taga dakbayan o lalawigan sa Sugbo, sa pagka karon mahimong maabagan ka sa paglukat sa maong libro sa atong higala nga si kapitan Tiago. 
						<br><br>
						Sa dugang kasayuran, ayaw pag panuko sa pag sampit ni Serapio.ph. Kana bitawng murag kilat sa ubos kilid sa imong tuong bahin, tuploka na ug ipadayag ang inyong katuyoan aron atong mahatagan ug pagtagad.
